My solution for [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022).

All solutions are packaged as a Swift CLI executable. You can pass arguments to solve a puzzle for
a specific part of a specific day. You can find example inputs in the [inputs folder](inputs).

Here is how you can get a solution to a puzzle:
```sh
swift run solve-aoc --day 1 --part two inputs/day1-example
```
